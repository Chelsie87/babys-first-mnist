# babys-first-mnist

This project is one of my all-time favorites that I have worked on. Intro to AI made me realize what branch of CS interests me the most.

Fatima Baltovic and I worked on a handwriting recognition project using the MNIST database. 
We considered creating this in C++, but opted to use Python. Both of us had limited Python knowledge and experience.
This project is akin to a "Hello World" program in the world of AI.
Due to the magnitude of projects centered around the MNIST database, 
I did my best to understand the different functions of the keras and tensorflow libraries (my comments document this well) and explain them to fellow classmates.

GUI CREATION CODE USED FROM: 
https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-deep-learning-project-handwritten-digit-recognition/
***We worked on this project for 2.5 weeks, and presented to out class. 
We decided that the presentation would benifit from a visual demonstration.
This GUI allows you to draw a number and have the trained neural network guess which number it belives you drew.
I slightly tweaked the code so the number was more easily detected and read.***

There is also a PowerPoint presentation for anyone interested.
